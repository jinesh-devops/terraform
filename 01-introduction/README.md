# Terraform Introduction

## What is Terraform?
- Open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp
- Lets you define cloud resources in code and provision them automatically
- Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)

## Why Terraform?
- Replaces manual cloud console clicks with repeatable code
- Works across AWS, Azure, GCP and 1000+ providers
- State management tracks what's deployed

## Core Workflow
terraform init      → download providers/plugins
terraform plan      → preview what will be created
terraform apply     → create the infrastructure
terraform destroy   → tear everything down
